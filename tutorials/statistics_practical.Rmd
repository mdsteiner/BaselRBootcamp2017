## Tasks

### Gettting started

A. For this practical, we'll use the `trialact` dataframe from the `speff2trial` package, load the package with the `library()` function. Also load the `tidyverse` as always!

```{r, message = FALSE, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(speff2trial)
```


B. Now save a copy of the data as a tibble called `trialact`

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
trialact <- as_tibble(ACTG175)
```


C. First thing's first, take a look at the data by printing it. It should look like this

```{r, eval = TRUE}
trialact
```


### Descriptive statistics



### T tests with t.test()

1. Conduct a one-sample t-test comparing the age of the patients versus a null hypothesis of 40 years. What is the p-value? Do you accept or reject the hull hypothesis?

```{r}
t.test(x = trialact$age,
       alternative = "two.sided",
       mu = 40)
```

2. Now, compare the mean age to a null hypothesis of 35 years. What has changed?

```{r}
t.test(x = trialact$age,
       alternative = "two.sided",
       mu = 35)
```

3. Conduct a two-sample t-test comparing the age of men versus women

  - Women are coded as 0 in `gender`, and men are coded as 1. 
  - Be sure to use the formula notation `formula = age ~ gender`

```{r}
t.test(formula = age ~ gender,
       data = trialact,
       alternative = "two.sided")
```


4. Conduct a two-sample t-test comparing the number of days until the first occurrence of a major negative event (`days`) between those with a history of intravenous drug use (`drugs`) and those without a history of intravenous drug use

```{r}
t.test(formula = days ~ drugs,
       data = trialact)
```


### Correlation test with cor.test()

5. Do older people tend to weigh more? Conduct a correlation test between weight (`wtkg`) and age (`age`). What is your conclusion?

```{r}
cor.test(formula = ~ age + wtkg,
         data = trialact)
```

6. We would expect a correlation between CD4 T cell count at baseline (`cd40`) and at 20 weeks (`cd420`). But how strong is the correlation? Answer this question by conducting a correlation test between CD4 T cell count at baseline (`cd40`) and CD4 T cell count at 20 weeks (`cd420`).

```{r}
cor.test(formula = ~ cd40 + cd420,
         data = trialact)
```

7. Is there a relationship between CD4 T cell count at baseline (`cd40`) and the number of days until the first occurrence of major negative event (`days`)?

```{r}
cor.test(formula = ~ cd40 + days,
         data = trialact)
```

8. Only considering men, is there a correlation between CD4 T cell count at baseline (`cd40`)and CD8 T cell count at baseline (`cd80`)?

  - Include the argument `subset = gender == 0` to restrict the analysis to men
    
```{r}
cor.test(formula = ~ cd40 + cd80,
         data = trialact,
         subset = gender == 0)
```

9. Now, repeat the previous test, but only for women

```{r}
cor.test(formula = ~ cd40 + cd80,
         data = trialact,
         subset = gender == 1)
```

### Chi-square test with chisq.test()

10. Do men and women (`gender`) have different distributions of race (`race`)? That is, is the percentage of women who are white differ from the percentage of men who are white?

  - Be sure to create a table of gender and race values with `table(trialact$gender, trialact$race)`

```{r}
chisq.test(table(trialact$gender, trialact$race))
```

11. Is there a relationship between a history of intravenous drug use (`drugs`) and hemophilia (`hemo`)?

```{r}
chisq.test(table(trialact$hemo, trialact$drugs))
```

12. Is there a relationship between homosexual activity (`homo`) and gender (`gender`)

```{r}
chisq.test(table(trialact$homo, trialact$gender))
```

13. Only for patients older than 40, is there a relationship between antiretroviral history (`str2`) and race (`race`)?

   - Create a new dataframe called `trialact.o40 <- subset(trialact, age > 40)` and then do your analysis on this new dataframe.
   
   
```{r}
trialact.o40 <- subset(trialact, age > 40)

chisq.test(table(trialact.o40$str2, trialact.o40$race))
```

14. Now repeat the previous analysis, but only for male patients

  - Create a new dataframe called `trialact.male <- subset(trialact, gender == 0)` and then do your analysis on this new dataframe.

```{r}
trialact.male <- subset(trialact, gender == 0)

chisq.test(table(trialact.male$str2, trialact.male$race))
```

### ANOVA with aov()

15. One of the main research hypotheses might be that there is an effect of treatment on CD8 T cell count at 20 weeks of treatment. Test this hypothesis to see if there an effect of treatment arms (`arms`) on CD8 T cell count at 20 weeks (`cd820`). If there is a significant effect, conduct post-hoc tests to see which treatment arms differed. 

```{r}
arms_cd820_aov <- aov(formula = cd820 ~ factor(arms),
                     data = trialact)

summary(arms_cd820_aov)

TukeyHSD(arms_cd820_aov)
```


16. A researcher might be concerned that certain treatments might lead to substantial weight-loss or weight-gain. Answer this question by testing if there an effect of treatment arms (`arms`) on weight (`wtkg`). If the effect is significant, conduct post-hoc tests.

```{r}
arms_weight_aov <- aov(formula = wtkg ~ factor(arms),
                     data = trialact)

summary(arms_weight_aov)

TukeyHSD(arms_weight_aov)
```


17. The main variable of interest is if there is an effect of treatment arms (`arms`) on the number of days until the occurrence of a major negative event (`days`). Answer this by conducting the appropriate ANOVA (with post-hoc tests if necessary).

    
```{r}
arms_days_aov <- aov(formula = days ~ factor(arms),
                     data = trialact)

summary(arms_days_aov)

TukeyHSD(arms_days_aov)
```


18. Does the previous result hold if you only consider patients with a history of intravenous drug use (`drugs`)? Answer this by conducting the same ANOVA *only* on these patients.

   - Create a new dataframe called `trialact_drugs = subset(trialact, drugs == 1)` and run your analysis on this dataframe
   
```{r}
trialact_drugs <- subset(trialact, drugs == 1)

arms_days_drugs_aov <- aov(formula = days ~ factor(arms),
                           data = trialact_drugs)

summary(arms_days_drugs_aov)

TukeyHSD(arms_days_drugs_aov)
```

## Extras and Challenges

19. Conduct a two-way ANOVA testing the effects of *both* hemophilia (`hemo`) and drug use (`drugs`) on the number of days until a major negative event.

   - To include multiple factors in an anova, just include both in the formula such as: `formula = dv ~ factor(x) + factor(y) + ... `. See https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/anova.html#ex-two-way-anova for an example
    
```{r}
hemo_drugs_days_aov <- aov(formula = days ~ factor(hemo) + factor(drugs),
                           data = trialact)

summary(hemo_drugs_days_aov)
```


20. Repeat the previous ANOVA, but now test if there is an *interaction* between hemophilia and drugs on the number of days until a major negative event.

   - To include interactions in an ANOVA, just include both in the formula using the `*` operator: `formula = dv ~ factor(x) * factor(y)`. See https://bookdown.org/ndphillips/YaRrr/anova.html#ex-two-way-anova for an example
    
```{r}
hemo_drugs_days_aov <- aov(formula = days ~ factor(hemo) * factor(drugs),
                           data = trialact)

summary(hemo_drugs_days_aov)
```

21. Is there a difference in the CD4 T cell count at baseline between whites and non-whites? Answer this by conducting the appropriate hypothesis test.

```{r}
t.test(formula = cd40 ~ race,
       data = trialact,
       alternative = "two.sided")
```

22. A researcher is particularly interested in whether or not there is a difference in the number of days until the first occurrence of a major negative event between patients taking zidovudine and those taking didanosine. Conduct the appropriate test to answer this question.
    
```{r}
t.test(formula = days ~ arms,
       data = trialact,
       subset = arms %in% c(0, 3))
```

23. A researcher wants to know if the relationship between CD4 T cell count at baseline and age is the same for whites and non-whites. Conduct the appropriate statistical test separately for both groups. Are the conclusions the same or different?

```{r}
cor.test(formula = ~ cd40 + days,
         data = subset(trialact, race == 0))

cor.test(formula = ~ cd40 + days,
         data = subset(trialact, race == 1))
```

24. A researcher is concerned that patients were not properly randomly assigned to the different treatment arms. Using the appropriate test(s), see if there is a significant imbalance between treatment arms in terms of gender, drug use, race, and homosexual activity. Do you find evidence for a significant imbalance in any of these domains?

```{r}
chisq.test(table(trialact$gender, trialact$arms))
chisq.test(table(trialact$race, trialact$arms))
chisq.test(table(trialact$drugs, trialact$arms))
```
