### Overview

In this practical you'll practice "data wrangling" with the `dplyr` package. Data wrangling refers to modifying and summarizing data. For example, sorting, adding columns, recoding values, 

If you don't have it already, you can access the dplyr cheatsheet here [https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf). This has a nice overview of all the major functions in dplyr.

### Glossary

Here are the main verbs you will be using in `dplyr`:

| verb| action| example |
|:---|:------------------------------------|:----------------|
|     `filter()`|    Select rows based on some criteria| data %>% filter(age > 40 & sex == "m")|
|     `arrange()`|    Sort rows| data %>% arrange(date, group)|
|     `select()`|    Select columns (and ignore all others)| data %>% select(age, sex)|
|     `rename()`|    Rename columns| data %>% rename(DATE_MONTHS_X24, date)|
|     `mutate()`|    Add new columns| data %>% mutate(height.m = height.cm / 100)|
|     `case_when()`|    Recode values of a column| data %>% sex.n = case_when(sex == 0 ~ "m", sex == 1 ~ "f")|
|     `group_by(), summarise()`|   Group data and then calculate summary statistics|data %>% group_by(...) %>% summarise(...)|

### Examples

- The following examples will take you through the steps of doing data wrangling with dplyr. Try to go through each line of code and see how it works!

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# -----------------------------------------------
# Examples of using dplyr on the ChickWeight data
# ------------------------------------------------

library(tidyverse)         # Load tidyverse

chick <- as_tibble(ChickWeight)   # Save a copy of the ChickWeight data as chick

# Add columns with mutate()

chick <- chick %>%
  mutate(
    weight.kg = weight / 1000,  # Add new column of weight in kilograms
    time.week = Time / 7        # Add time.week as time in weeks
  )

# Sort rows with arrange()

chick <- chick %>%
  arrange(Diet, weight)   # sort rows by Diet and then weight


# Recode variables with case_when()

chick <- chick %>%
  mutate(
    diet.name = case_when(
      Diet == 1 ~ "vegetables",
      Diet == 2 ~ "fruit",
      Diet == 3 ~ "candy",
      Diet == 4 ~ "meat"
      
    )
  )

# Grouped statistics with group_by() and summarise()

chick %>% 
  group_by(Diet) %>%
  summarise(
    weight.mean = mean(weight),
    weight.max = max(weight),
    time.mean = mean(Time)
    N = n()
  ) %>%
  arrange(weight.mean)


# Many sequential functions

chick %>%
  filter(Chick > 10) %>%              # Only chicks with values larger than 10
  group_by(Time, Diet) %>%            # Group by Time and Diet
  summarise(
    weight.median = median(weight),
    weight.sd = sd(weight),
    N = n()                           # Counts of cases
  )

```


### Tasks

1. First, load the set of `tidyverse` packages with `library()`

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
```


2. For this practical, we'll use the `aidstrial` dataframe from the `speff2trial` package, load the package with the `library()` function (along with `tidyverse` as always)

```{r, message = FALSE, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```


3. Now save a copy of the data as a tibble called `aidstrial`. This way if you do something wrong to the data, you can always get the original back.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
aidstrial <- read_csv(file = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therbootcamp/BaselRBootcamp2017/master/tutorials/data/aidstrial.csv")
```


4. First thing's first, take a look at the first few rows of the data by printing it. It should look like this:

```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
aidstrial
```

### `mutate()`

5. Add a new column to the dataframe called `age_months` that shows each patient's age in months instead of years.

```{r}
aidstrial <- aidstrial %>% mutate(
  age_months = age * 12
)
```

6. The column `karnof` shows each patient's [Karnofsky score](http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/2172510-overview) on a scale from 0 to 100, create a new variable called `karnof_b` that shows the score on a scale from 0 to 1 (hint: just divide the original column by 100)

```{r}
aidstrial <- aidstrial %>% 
  mutate(
         karnof_b = karnof / 100
        )
```

7. Now, do the previous two questions in one chunk of code. That is, using one call to `mutate()` create both `age_months` and `karnof_b`

```{r}
aidstrial <- aidstrial %>% 
 mutate(
    age_months = age * 12,
    karnof_b = karnof / 100
    )
```

8. A physician wants to see a new score called the `sparrow` which is equal to the Karnofsky score divided by a person's age plus the person's weight in kg. Add each participant's sparrow score as a new column called `sparrow` (Hint: Just take `karnof / age + wtkg)

```{r}
aidstrial <- aidstrial %>% 
 mutate(
    sparrow = karnof / age + wtkg
    )
```

### `arrange()`

9. Arrange the `aidstrial` data in ascending order of age (from lowest to highest). After, look at the first few rows of the data with `head()` to make sure it worked.

```{r}
aidstrial <- aidstrial %>% 
 arrange(age)
```

10. Now arrange the data in descending order of age (from highest to lowest). After, look at the first few rows of the data with `head()` to make sure it worked.

   - To arrange data in descending order, just include `desc()` around the variable. E.g.; `data %>% arrrange(desc(height))`

11. You can sort the rows of dataframes with multiple columns by including many arguments to `arrange()`. Now sort the data by `karnof` and then age (`age`), and then arms (`arms`)

```{r}
aidstrial <- aidstrial %>% 
 arrange(karnof, age, arms)
```

### `case_when()`

12. Create a new column `gender_char` that shows gender as a string.

   - Look at the help file with `?ACTG175` to see how gender is coded.
    
```{r}
aidstrial <- aidstrial %>%
  mutate(
  gender.char = case_when(
    gender == 0 ~ "female",
    gender == 1 ~ "male"
  )
  )
```


13. Create a new column `over50` that is 1 when patients are older than 50, and 0 when they are younger than or equal to 50

```{r}
aidstrial <- aidstrial %>%
  mutate(
  over50 = case_when(
    age > 50 ~ 1,
    age <= 50 ~ 0
  )
  )
```


14. Now, repeat the previous two questions, but do them both in the same call to `mutate()`. That is, in one block of code, create `gender_char` and `over50`

```{r}
aidstrial <- aidstrial %>%
  mutate(
    gender.char = case_when(
    gender == 0 ~ "female",
    gender == 1 ~ "male"),
  over50 = case_when(
    age > 50 ~ 1,
    age <= 50 ~ 0)
  )
```


### `group_by()` and `summarise()`

15. For each arm, calculate the mean participant age.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
aidstrial %>% 
  group_by(arms) %>%
  summarise(
    age.mean = mean(age)
  )
```

16. For each arm, calculate the mean participant age *and* the median Karnofsky score

```{r}
aidstrial %>% 
  group_by(arms) %>%
  summarise(
    age.mean = mean(age),
    karnof.median = median(karnof)
  )
```

17. Separately for male and female patients, calculate the percent who have a history of intravenous drug use.

   - To calculate a percent of a binary variable with 0s and 1s, just calculate the mean

```{r}
aidstrial %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%
  summarise(
    drug.percent = mean(drugs)
  )
```

18. Separately for male and female patients (`gender`), calculate the percent who have a history of intravenous drug use (`drugs`), and the percent of patients who indicate homosexual activity

```{r}
aidstrial %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%
  summarise(
    drug.percent = mean(drugs),
    homo.percent = mean(homo)
  )
```


19. Separately for all combinations of gender and race, calculate the mean age and mean CD4 T cell count at baseline (`cd40`) (Hint: group by `gender` and `race`)

```{r}
aidstrial %>%
  group_by(gender, race) %>%
  summarise(
    age.mean = mean(age),
    cd40.mean = mean(cd40)
  )
```


### Challenges

20. Now let's check the major differences between the treatment arms. For each arm, calculate the following:

   - Mean days until a a major negative event (`days`)
   - Mean CD4 T cell count at baseline.
   - Mean CD4 T cell count at 20 weeks.
   - Mean CD4 T cell count at 96 weeks.
   - Mean *change* in CD4 T cell count between baseline and 96 weeks
   - Number of patients (Hint: use `N = n()`)

```{r}
aidstrial %>%
  group_by(arms) %>%
  summarise(
    days_mean = mean(days),
    cd4_bl = mean(cd40),
    cd4_20 = mean(cd420),
    cd4_96 = mean(cd496, na.rm = TRUE),
    cd4_change = mean(cd496 - cd40, na.rm = TRUE),
    N = n()
  )
```

21. Repeat the previous analysis, but before you do the grouping and summary statistics, recode the values of `arms` to text that reflect what the values actually represent. For example, looking at the help file `?ACTG175`, I can see that the treatment arm of - is "zidovudine". I might call this arm `"Z"`. Do this in the all in the same chunk of code.


```{r}
aidstrial %>%
  mutate(
    arms = case_when(
      arms == 0 ~ "Z",
      arms == 1 ~ "ZD",
      arms == 2 ~ "ZZ",
      arms == 3 ~ "D"
    )
  ) %>%
  group_by(arms) %>%
  summarise(
    days_mean = mean(days),
    cd4_bl = mean(cd40),
    cd4_20 = mean(cd420),
    cd4_96 = mean(cd496, na.rm = TRUE),
    cd4_change = mean(cd496 - cd40, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

22. Repeat the previous analysis, but only include patients with a Karnofsky score equal to 100, and who did not use zidovudine in the 30 days prior to the treatment initiation (`z30`)

```{r}
aidstrial %>%
  filter(karnof == 100 & z30 == 0) %>%
  mutate(
    arms = case_when(
      arms == 0 ~ "Z",
      arms == 1 ~ "ZD",
      arms == 2 ~ "ZZ",
      arms == 3 ~ "D"
    )
  ) %>%
  group_by(arms) %>%
  summarise(
    days_mean = mean(days),
    cd4_bl = mean(cd40),
    cd4_20 = mean(cd420),
    cd4_96 = mean(cd496, na.rm = TRUE),
    cd4_change = mean(cd496 - cd40, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```
