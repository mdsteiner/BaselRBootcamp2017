## Clinical Study

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Load packages
library(tidyvserse)
library(BayesFactor)
library(lme4)
```

The study data is stored as a comma-separated text file called `clinical_study.csv`. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Load the data from the data folder
clinical_study <- read_csv(file = "data/clinical_study.csv")
```

### Primary Measures

The primary measure was whether patient's quality of life significantly improved. The following plot shows how quality of life changed over time, separated by different treatment groups:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Line graph showing QOL over time

ggplot(data = clinical_study,
       mapping = aes(x = time, y = qol, col = arm)) +
  geom_line()

```
